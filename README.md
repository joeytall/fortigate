Application made for Question 5
===================================

**npm install**

**npm start**

**chrome http://localhost:3000/**

My straightforward approach allows users to simply browser through the entire application data list and search for their desired application.

Here is question 5 if you are curious.
5) The following question is optional, and can be submitted outside of the original time limits of this test.
FortiGate appliances are equipped with application control features to detect, monitor and block applications on a network. Fortinet has a large collection of signatures to identify applications based on their traffic patterns. For more information on application control, you can visit the following link:
http://www.fortinet.com/support/fortiguard_services/application_control.html
For this question, you can build a small web application which loads a sample list of application signatures (http://www.fortinet.com/test.json), and presents them in a manner that is easy to read and understand. Users must be able to search the list of signatures by name to find a specific application. You may build any additional features that you find useful.
You may use any programming languages, tools or libraries that you have available.
