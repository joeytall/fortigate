# FortiGuard Application Control 

Application made for Question 5
-----------------------------------------

**npm install**

**npm start**

**chrome http://localhost:3000/**

My straightforward approach allows users to simply browser through the entire application data list and search for their desired application.

The data table can be sorted, searched and paginated.

Third party tool used:
jquery-dynatable
